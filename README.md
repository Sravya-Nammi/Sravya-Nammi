<h2>👩‍💻 About Me</h2>

I'm a frontend developer with a passion for building real-time, responsive, and scalable web applications. My experience spans Angular, React, TypeScript, and integrating APIs in cloud and IoT environments. I also bring backend know-how with Python and Node.js, and have deployed projects using AWS, Docker, and MQTT protocols.

Currently learning German 🇩🇪 (B1 in progress) and exploring ways to merge cloud, automation, and frontend technologies to build smart, connected systems.
